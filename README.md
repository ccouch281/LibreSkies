# LibreSkies

This repository is a lightweight starter to host the LibreSkies project on GitHub. It contains a short set of instructions for GitHub Copilot and contributors to follow the project's coding conventions.

See `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the coding style rules Copilot (and contributors) should follow.

Quick start

- Initialize the repo (if you haven't already):
  - `git init`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Initial commit: add README and Copilot instructions"`

Files added

- `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — explicit instructions for Copilot/code generation.
- `.gitignore` — minimal ignores for common artifacts.

Notes

- These files are intentionally minimal. If you want repository templates for specific languages (C#, TypeScript, Python), I can add language-specific editorconfig or linter configs to enforce these rules automatically.
